Subject: [PATCH 258/322] [FIO toup] imx8mm_evk: define default dfu_alt_info
 for emmc updates

Define dfu_alt_info to allow updating SPL/imx-boot and u-boot.itb via
DFU (which is also used by EFI capsule updates).

Upstream note: standard SPL seems to be called flash.bin (generated by
u-boot), so needs to be aligned there. Here we're also using the offset
and size for what we consider the first slot (when taking multiboot as
consideration), but that shouldn't be an issue with upstream.
