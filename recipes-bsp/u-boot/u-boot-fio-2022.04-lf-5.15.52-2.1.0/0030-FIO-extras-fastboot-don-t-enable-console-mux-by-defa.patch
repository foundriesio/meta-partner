Subject: [PATCH 030/233] [FIO extras] fastboot: don't enable console mux by
 default

This is required for enabling console/uart output at uuu, but this
shouldn't be set by default as it doesn't work properly with every
target yet (e.g. imx7ulp).

Users can still set both options manually if they want such
functionality.
